# MOD8 Assign Prog 1:
    a. The first is k2m, which will convert kilometers to miles by multiplying by 10 and dividing by 16.
    b, The second function  is mph(int miles, int hours), which will calculate miles per hour by dividing miles (in r0), by hours (in r1), and returning the value in r0.   
    c. The third function is kph, and MUST be calculated by converting the kilometers to miles, and calling mph().  You must call the mph function, do not calculate the kph in this method.

# MOD8 Assign Prog 2:
Write the functions CToF and InchesToFt and add it to the conversions.s file. Write a main program to call it and test it.  (40 points)  For the InchesToFt, you can earn an extra 10 points by using implied decimals to print out the InchesToFt.
